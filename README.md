Seymour
=======
This mod addresses a concern I had about the new hunger system involving saturation and exhaustion. With those added, it's somewhat unfair to only heal at above 18 food level (scale is 0-20). This lets you customize those amounts.

Download
--------
You can find the [latest release here](https://github.com/NationsAtWar/Seymour/releases/latest).

Requirements
------------
Forge Version: 1.6.4

Installation
------------
Drag it into your mods folder, like any other plugin.

Apparently you can add this plugin to your server, and it will work without the clients having it.
